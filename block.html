                Rangamati (Bengali: রাঙ্গামাটি;) is the administrative headquarter and town of Rangamati Hill District in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. The town is located at 22°37'60N 92°12'0E and has an altitude of 14 metres (46 ft).[1] It is also where Ropuiliani, a Mizo chieftess, was jailed and died, during the British rule in Mizoram.[2][3]

From Chittagong a 77 kilometres (48 mi) road leads to Rangamati. The township is located on the western bank of the Kaptai lake. Rangamati is a holiday destination because of its landscape, scenery, lake, indigenous groups (Chakma, Marma, Mizo, Tripuri, Tanchangya, etc.), flora and fauna, indigenous museum and hanging bridge.

        Construction of the reservoir for the hydro-electric plant began in 1956 by the Government of East Pakistan.[2] As a result, 54,000 acres (220 km2) of farmland in the Rangamati District went underwater and created the lake. The project was finished in 1961.[3] 40% of the total arable land went underwater as a result of the dam construction and 100,000 people were displaced.[3] The palace of the king of the Chakmas was also flooded and is also underwater.[2] The International Engineering Company and Utah International Inc. received the contract for construction of the dam. The dam is 670.8 meters long, and 54.7 meters high.
